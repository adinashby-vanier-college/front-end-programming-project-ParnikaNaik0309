    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      Hi, I'm <strong>Parnika Naik</strong>, an aspiring software developer currently pursuing a diploma in Software Development at Vanier College in Montreal, Canada. With a passion for technology and a keen eye for problem-solving, I'm dedicated to crafting innovative and user-friendly software solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      My journey into the world of programming began during my university days in India. Since then, I've been immersed in learning various programming languages and technologies, including <strong>Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and React</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through my studies at Vanier College, I've gained hands-on experience in <strong>web development, mobile app development, data analysis, and machine learning</strong>. I'm eager to apply my knowledge and skills to real-world projects and contribute to the development of cutting-edge applications.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond coding, I'm passionate about <strong>gaming, music, sports, and volunteering</strong>. I believe that a well-rounded individual is a better problem-solver, and I strive to maintain a balance between my academic and personal pursuits.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm excited to connect with like-minded individuals and explore new opportunities in the tech industry. Feel free to reach out to me via email or connect with me on social media.
